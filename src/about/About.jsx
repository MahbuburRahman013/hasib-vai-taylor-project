                    <p className='mt-5 text-gray-700'>We empower learners, thinkers, and doers with trusted knowledge that advances research and enriches lives.

                    <h1 className='mt-14 text-3xl text-gray-700'>Our story</h1>
                    <p className='font-bold mt-5 text-gray-700'>We’ve been advancing research and enriching lives since the 18th Century.</p>
                    <p className='mt-5 text-gray-700'>Taylor & Francis was founded in London in 1852, but our roots go back to 1798 when Richard Taylor launched the Philosophical Magazine, one of the first scientific journals. Routledge, which Taylor & Francis acquired in 1998, was also founded in 1852 and is now considered to be the leading English-language publisher of humanities and social sciences. The merged company has become one of the top five research publishers globally.</p>
                    <p className='mt-5 text-gray-700'>In 2003 we acquired CRC Press, best known for titles in engineering, materials science, and mathematics. In 2004 Taylor & Francis merged with Informa, and has been its academic publishing division since then.</p>
                    <p className='mt-5 text-gray-700'>More recent acquisitions include Dove Medical Press in 2017, which specializes in medical journals. In 2020 we acquired F1000, which provides open research publishing venues that support data deposition and sharing to research funders and institutions. These include the European Commission, Wellcome, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
                    <p className='mt-5 text-gray-700'>In 2023 we expanded our medical publishing further with the acquisition of 27 new journals and six digital hubs – online communities for medical and scientific professionals. We also extended our offering of publishing solutions to medical communications agencies, including our market-leading Plain Language Summary service. And in 2024, we acquired PeerJ, an award-winning Open Access science publisher with seven fully Open Access journals in biomedical, life, environmental, physical, and computer sciences.</p>
                    <p className='mt-5 text-gray-700'>Today our brands advance knowledge across humanities and social sciences, science and technology, engineering, medicine, and healthcare.</p>
